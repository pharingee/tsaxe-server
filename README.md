## What is tsaxe

tsaxe is a low-maintenance public blog application that uses markdown to generate json files which can be served from a file server. This allows you to keep the server private to a small team or even run locally.

## Why tsaxe?

As does everyone else in the world, I got to a point in my life where I thought people should be burdened with the thoughts that come out of my head. So I needed a blog. The problem was every blogging application out there required keeping a server running when really, all I needed was to jot some notes down and forget about them. No authentication required to read me ramble on about whimsical thoughts.

So I decided to build an application that will take my thoughts and convert them into a static mode that didn't need a running server to serve to the world. While I was at it, I realized this same components could be used to build a simple personal website, where anyone could use to show their resume, portfolio, and write a blog. So many people must need this, I thought. So I open sourced it from get go so no onne else would need to build it.

## What does tsaxe mean?

tsaxe (pronounced tsa-her) is the [Ewe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewe_language) word for [Guinea fowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guineafowl) which are among the most resilient, lowest maintenance poultry in the world. When I decided to build an efficient blog application that will allow me edit my posts and still be able to serve them statically, I thought this will be a nice name for a low maintenance blog post where you only had to worry about the static files. A blog built using tsaxe will stay up even when the server is down.
